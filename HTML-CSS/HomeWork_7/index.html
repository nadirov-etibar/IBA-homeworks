        <p>ATTACK OF THE FRONTEND</p>
        <p>
            When there is no more hope. When Winter is coming. When the
            White Walkers prepare to break down the Wall and JAVA can no longer

        </p><p>  Comes he - Javascript. Lord of untyped data and components,
        he does not give up technical tasks "to do nicely" and is not afraid of
        calculations on the user side. But he comes not alone, having 3 of his
        faithful
        friends with him: jQuery, React.js and Node.js.
